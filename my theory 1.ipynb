    "\n",
    "This is random yap about my thoughts after getting to know about quantum entanglement, the existance of wavefunctions in the form of multiple states called superposition, and how the QZE explains that an observer can cause a wavefunction collapse.. and the fact that consciousness cannot exist without time...\n",
    "\n",
    "Einstien once stated that only massless objects like photons can travel at the speed of light. Technically, according to him as we approach the speed of light, time slows down for US compared to someone who isnt moving , so ONCE WE reach the speed of light or once we *hypothetically* happen to travel at it, time is frozen. Like if a photon leaves a star thousands of years ago n hits our eyes, in its pov it made the trip instantly, also known as time dilation, at light speed, wherein time = 0.... sooo when time's 0, then consiousness doesnt exist. Our thoughts would stop flowin and what not...\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, my mind made up this analogy which also involves quantum entanglement, which states that at quantum level, two particles are connected to each other in such a way that no matter how much the distance of seperation is between the both, a change in state in one would cause something similar in the other too...\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what if ...\n",
    "~everything im gonna yap from here is pretty hypothetical but not wrong either, its just what is theoritically possible, and rather something I came up with mixing allot of theories in a non conventional way~\n",
    "\n",
    "What if there was a world, wherein everything existed at speed of light, which practically means only massless stuff exist there. Physics does state that wave functions are massless. And we also know that at quantum level, substances exist at superpositions and at any number of states until unless someone observes them and a wavefunction collapse occurs.. ( stated by QZE )\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if u consider yourself to be a wavefunction, existing at multiple states and since in that world, time doesnt exist, neither would your consiousness. So you would js be a wave function and a possibility, and not yourself. Now, in that world, since it exists at the speed of light, quantum entanglement works. So your one state is linked to another through this... \n",
    "\n",
    "What if somehow, someone observes you ( someone in a place where time exists, someone with consiousness), and since QZE states that a wavefunction collapse occurs once observation happens, a state of you collapses and enters the world \n",
    "where time exists. Now, this state of you would be conscious since time would exist there and you would still be quantumly entagled with some 'x' state of yourself in that time frozen world you collapsed from...\n",
    "\n",
    "So, can a conscious version of me, collapsed into time.. control the rest of me(existing as a probability or wave fxn) thats stuck in timeless quantum world because quantum entanglement IS a thing...???\n",
