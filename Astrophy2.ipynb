    "The schrodinger's wave function says us not about the exact presence or absence of an electron, but about the probability of it being present or absent:- also known as electron density.\n",
    "Now, why would an electron typically be absent at a certain place? Why arent the electrons randomly scattered across the nucleus?\n",
    "Why are they present at certain places where the electron density is high?\n",
    "These places are known as energy levels.\n",
    "Allot of us probably think electrons and photons only exhibit one type of nature:- particle. Since obviously, theyre particles arent they? But whats shocking is, they show dual nature- of both a particle and a wave... but how???\n",
    "\n",
    "An electron acts as a standing wave. But why and how?\n",
    "\n",
    "If it was just a tiny particle - then why everytime we try to measure where it is precisely, we end up losing track of how fast or where it's going?... this is known as the <i>Principle of Superposition</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "Also the double slit experiment, where we gun out an electron one at a time showed that, it forms ripples and <i>interferes</i> with itself rather than acting just like a particle. Which takes us to a conclusion that it creates interferance patterns which only waves exhibit. But here's the catch~ an electron isnt a moving wave- its a standing one... \n",
    "\n",
    "Now whats a moving wave and standing wave?\n",
    "\n",
    "If waves are not bound and are free to move- theyre called as moving waves. So yall prolly know that an electrons are bound around an atom (specifically talking about them, not free electrons), and theyre confined to a specific <b>Couloumb Potential </b>(the pull by the nucleus)  ... so they act as standing waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "So the reason the electron doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äúsit‚Äù somewhere or move around like a planet is because:\n",
    "üîπ It's a wave,\n",
    "üîπ Confined to specific patterns (standing waves),\n",
    "üîπ And its stability comes from constructive interference ‚Äî only whole numbers of wavelengths ‚Äúfit‚Äù around the atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what if we try to excite an electron to a higher energy level?\n",
    "Wouldn't that go against the idea that an electron can only exist at specific wavelengths and energy levels?\n",
    "Well ‚Äî kinda, yeah. That's why electrons don‚Äôt just jump to any energy level ‚Äî they only go to levels where a stable standing wave (with a whole number of wavelengths) can exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when we excite an electron, we have to give it just the right amount of energy ‚Äî matching the difference between two allowed energy levels. If that works, the electron temporarily jumps up to the higher level.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it doesn‚Äôt stay there forever ‚Äî it‚Äôs unstable.\n",
    "So what does it do?\n",
    "\n",
    "üí• It drops back down to its lower energy level and emits a photon with exactly the same energy as the gap between the two levels.\n",
    "This isn‚Äôt to ‚Äúnullify‚Äù the energy‚Äî it‚Äôs just nature‚Äôs way of balancing the books.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standing wave pattern shifts to match the new energy level ‚Äî which means the wavelength and shape of the wave changes, but still obeys the rule of constructive interference, and not destructive which ofcourse prevents the atom from self destructing\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, on what basis is an energy level labelled as \"allowed\" while exciting it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, an electron can only exist where the wavefunction holds true, and theres a non zero value to it, meaning theres a 'x' amount of probability for it to exist, while maintaining the stability of the atom.\n",

    "\n",
    "Okay so basically THIS TOPIC IS SO OUT OF THE CONTEXT lol, but no worries. This aint Feynman's dump or some nerd's thesis. Its just me wondering about stuff like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sooo, think of an ant on one end of an apple tryna reach to the exactly opposite end. There's two ways it can do that~ go through by the circumference or dig a 'tunnel' to the opposite end. I guess its obvious enough that the second way is the so called 'shortcut'.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly where the concept of wormhole comes from, js like its name ... its a shortcut. \n",
    "But what kinda shortcut?\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, if we want to reduce the time we want to reach a place , we either increase our velocity or just reduce the distance. Conventionally, it's obvious for people to assume that reducing the distance means changing the destination. But the concept of wormholes states otherwise. The destination remains the same, but since you take a 'shortcut' to reaching it, the distance logically is reduced by ALLOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like, as in the concept of spacetime, if a satallite is trying to reach it a nearby star, it usually could take it 'x' light years, but with the help of a hypothetical wormhole, it can reach there in 'x' milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is where the plot twist enters, a wormhole self destructs itself insantly if we ever tried creating it with 'normal matter' with a attractive gravitational force. Because it causes the tunnel to cave in and just destruct itself. Attractive gravitational feild is produced by positive energy density. But what if we use something with a repulsive gravitational force  which counters gravity and keeps te tunnel open? This is what is known as 'exotic matter'. Its something with negative energy density and negative pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "But our current levels of knowledge do not allow us to generate such exotic matter..\n",
    "\n",
    "Wheeler, a scientist once suggested that at Planck's scale (10^-35 m) , the spacetime isnt smooth, which causes irregularities to form tiny wormholes which are known to self collapse too.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what's a planck's scale??\n",
    "It is the smallest unit at a quantum level till where the principles of physics, and relativity apply. Since allot of the theories dont apply beyond that scale, spacetime might not even be continous there- it might be quantised or irregular ( foamy )...\n",
    "The physics doesnt cease to exist , but needs a new language beyond the planck's scale ( at even more micro level )...\n",
    "\n",
    "Sooo for now wormholes are just hypothetical ... ( ik thats sad)\n",
